This site documents the Open Innovations plaform: the way that we build our projects.
It is mainly designed to act as a reference for the team, but we've made it available
under a Creative Commons Attribution {{ comp.license.part.cc_by() | safe }} license to
allow anyone to freely reuse and remix it.

For now, the site doesn't contain much more than a set of <a href='/principles/'>principles</a>
and a work-in-progress description of our [delivery process](/processes/delivery/),
but we've got big plans to document the tools, techniques and libraries that we've defined and
created over the last couple of years.
