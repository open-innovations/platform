This site documents the Open Innovations plaform: the way that we build our projects.
It is mainly designed to act as a reference for the team, but we've made it available
under a Creative Commons Attribution {{ comp.license.part.cc_by() | safe }} license to
allow anyone to freely reuse and remix it.

We're in the process of building out the site, so you'll find some content is in draft, or missing entirely.
For now, you can check out a brief [ overview of the
platform](/overview/), find out about some of the key [components](/components/), and read about the [technology stack](/tech-stack/) and [processes]() we use to make the site. These are all consistent with the core platform [principles](/principles/).
