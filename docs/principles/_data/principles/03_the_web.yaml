title: Use the web as it was intended

description: |
  The web was conceived as a massively interconnected library of knowledge.
  We believe that this still has enormous transformational power.
  Too often the web is seen as no more than a technical delivery platform.

  We strive to use the warp and weft of the web; URLs and hyperlinks;
  to build digital products that allow web standards to shine.

  This will means employing [cool URIs](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)
  and designing sane URL schemes for our sites.
