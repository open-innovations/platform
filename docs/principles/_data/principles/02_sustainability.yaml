title: Build for sustainability

description: |
  There is no planet B. We care about our use of resources. This will apply to our code as
  much as anything else.

  We strive to build digital products which are efficient when using computing power
  and network bandwidth.

  This will result in products which work fast for people that use them.
  These products will be more inclusive, being usable by people with older,
  lower powered devices accessing via slower, limited, or costly network connections.
  
  The [Green Software](https://greensoftware.foundation/) movement will inspire us.
