title: Polyglot development

description: |
  The web speaks many languages, and we believe that there is no reason to force our team
  to use just one.

  We strive to select tools which leave the choice of development to the individual
  whilst providing a framework to ensure that the diverse languages can speak to one another.

  This will ensure that we pick the right tool for the job.

  We will be aware of the risk of _my favourite tool_ becoming a
  [golden hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument).
